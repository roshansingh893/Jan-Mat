    title: "Universal Free Healthcare for All Citizens Below Poverty Line",
    category: "Health",
    description: "Every Indian citizen living below the poverty line should receive completely free primary and secondary healthcare services including doctor consultations, medicines, diagnostics, and hospitalisation. The scheme should be cashless and paperless, linked to Aadhaar for eligibility verification. Implementation through Ayushman Bharat expansion with an enhanced annual budget of 80,000 crore rupees. All empanelled government and private hospitals must mandatorily admit BPL patients. A dedicated Health Ombudsman in every district handles grievances within 15 days. Current Ayushman Bharat covers 5 lakh rupees per year per family but excludes OPD consultations and medicines. This proposal closes that critical gap and ensures no Indian dies or goes into debt due to lack of healthcare access.",

This proposal mandates posting of at least one trained clinical psychologist or counsellor at every PHC, and at least one psychiatrist at every Community Health Center (CHC). Tele-mental health services through the eSanjeevani platform extended to all districts. School counsellors mandatory in all government schools above 200 students.

This proposal mandates annual free health screening camps at ward level in urban areas and at gram panchayat level in rural areas. All citizens above 35 should receive annual blood pressure, blood sugar, BMI, and basic cancer screening tests free of cost. Mobile health vans to reach remote areas. Early detection reduces treatment costs by 60-70% and saves lives. Data linked to a National Health Registry for epidemiological tracking. A Preventive Health Score for each citizen updated annually.

BPL households to receive free basic internet of 5 GB per month funded through the Universal Service Obligation Fund. All gram panchayat offices to have high-speed WiFi hotspots. Internet access is now essential for education, healthcare, banking, and employment. Without it citizens are excluded from the digital economy and public services.

The framework establishes a National AI Regulatory Authority that classifies AI by risk: prohibited AI includes autonomous lethal weapons and social scoring; high-risk AI in health, judiciary, credit, and recruitment requires mandatory auditing, explainability, and human oversight; medium-risk AI requires registration; low-risk AI is self-regulated. Biometric surveillance in public spaces requires judicial approval. AI-generated content must be labelled. Companies deploying high-risk AI must maintain audit trails for 5 years. Penalties up to 500 crore rupees for violation. Citizens have the right to know when AI is making decisions affecting them and to challenge those decisions.",

    title: "Mandatory Open Source Government Software Policy",
    category: "Technology",
    description: "All software developed using public funds for government use must be released as open source within 2 years of deployment. This prevents vendor lock-in that currently costs the government an estimated 25,000 crore rupees annually in proprietary software licenses. A Government Open Source Repository would host all publicly funded software. Private vendors working on government contracts must assign IP rights to the government. This enables independent security audits, reduces costs, and allows state governments to reuse central government software. Countries like France, Germany, and Spain have successfully implemented similar policies. India's Digital Public Infrastructure including Aadhaar, UPI, and DIKSHA already demonstrates the power of open-source public technology.",

Only 27% of Indians are financially literate which leads to widespread debt traps, insurance fraud, and poor retirement planning.

Practical exercises include managing mock bank accounts, filing sample ITRs, and constructing a personal budget. Students completing the course receive a Financial Literacy Certificate.

A Biodegradable Transition Fund of 15,000 crore rupees will provide capital subsidies to manufacturers switching to eco-friendly alternatives including jute, paper, and banana-leaf products. Retailers caught distributing banned plastics face penalties of 1 lakh rupees for first offense and 5 lakh for repeat offense. Extended Producer Responsibility mandated for all packaging above 10 tonnes annual production. India generates 3.5 million tonnes of plastic waste annually of which only 30% is recycled.

A National Environment Liability Registry tracks all polluters and their restoration obligations. Restoration timelines enforced by the National Green Tribunal with contempt powers. Industries must post an Environment Performance Bond equivalent to 2% of annual revenues as insurance against pollution liabilities. Whistleblowers reporting pollution receive 10% of penalty recovered. Currently India loses 8.5% of GDP annually to environmental degradation.

Current target of 500 GW renewables by 2030 needs stronger legislative backing. All new residential buildings above 200 square meters must have mandatory rooftop solar. Industrial consumers above 1 MW must source 40% from renewables by 2030. A Green Energy Transition Fund of 2 lakh crore rupees supports state utilities in retiring coal plants and retaining coal workers through retraining. Coal plant phaseout timeline legally fixed at 2040. This positions India as the world renewable energy leader and reduces import dependence on fossil fuels while creating 3 million green jobs.",

A National Startup Credit Guarantee Fund provides collateral-free loans up to 50 lakh rupees at 6% interest. Government procurement must reserve 25% of contracts under 5 crore rupees for startups. Startup employees to receive ESOPs with simpler tax treatment. IP registration fees waived.
